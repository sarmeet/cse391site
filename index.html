        Hi, I am Sarmeet Singh, a student in Stony Brook University.
        I am currently enrolled in CSE 391 ("3D for Games and Video"
        ) for which I have set up this
        website. Here I will display my course's progression and other
        activities that go on in the class. Also I will post all blender
        and other image resources that I create throughout the semester.

        </p>

        <h3>The Course</h3>
        <p>This is a survey course of 3D modeling, rendering, and animation
            technologies, with an emphasis on character development for games and
            high definition video. There are two major deliverables for the course.
            One is a fully modeled, shaded and rigged character, integrated into a
            3D game environment. The other is a fully rendered 30 - 60 second scene,
            complete with lighting and animation, output in high definition</p>
